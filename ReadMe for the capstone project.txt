I was having some problems with the interface of collab and thus has to find some workarounds to complete this project.. !
Please note that I am working on this project on a Windows computer, and it might just be some issue due to my system. 

1. I have put a code block for uploading the database file since the original way that was done in the code wasn't working for me. 
  I have put the database file in the github repo as well, feel free to download it to use for running the code. 
  the database file is by the name of "dataset.csv" in the repository. 


2. the bokeh plotting feature was working very inconsistantly. I had to run the code 10 times before finding that the graph was coming out in only one of them. 
  I have checked the code throughtly and it seems that the problem is either with the interface, or the system :/
  for the same reason, I have downloaded the plot in form of png files and uploaded it in the repository as well.
  Please refer to that to get a better sense of what the plot looks like in case the code causes the same problem for you as well. :)
  The photos are by the name "SA2025_W5_Capstone_bokeh_plot_model_1" and "SA2025_W5_Capstone_bokeh_plot_model2".

Sorry for the inconvinience cased, I had to use these workarounds to make sure that I could submit the project in time. 

Thank you for being patient and understanding.
